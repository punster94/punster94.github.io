I completed my first  C-based game using an skeleton engine provided to me.
This exposed me to several patterns and practices that I was unfamiliar with:
* Singleton classes
* Spritesheet tables
* Usage of XInput
* Limitations of basic sound mixing

Coming from a background of highly object-oriented design, some of these I never had to get down and roll for myself.
I feel like this experience has improved my perception of how certain things are done in larger scale games, like 2D-animation and the chain of command.

The source for this project is available in the Projects tab or on my Github account page.
