Our first rapid prototype project in the FIEA curriculum carried the requirement that it be made in Flash (now Adobe Animate CC).
I worked as one of two programmers on a team of six people.
I was new to development in ActionScript3 so I learned a lot in the process.
In this time, I experienced the difference in development time gained from having a basic framing structure layed out prior to working on the actual meat of the game.

The game itself is played by two people locally on one computer.
They take turns commanding their lost units on the battlefield.
One commander aims to direct their unit to the extraction point, while the other makes commands to try intercepting the opposing unit before extraction.
The intercepting commander must issue two commands per turn.

The real strategic portion of the game is determining where you and your opponent exist on the board by reading the list of commands that succeeded or failed.
You can take plenty of time to search for any position you could have started at while guess-and-checking your way around, but you must be careful of your timer.
If you run out of time before your opponent, you lose!

Below is a video of a playthrough of the final game.
