Our first rapid prototype project in the FIEA curriculum carried the requirement that it be made in Flash (now Adobe Animate CC).
I worked as one of two programmers on a team of six people.
I was new to development in ActionScript3 so I learned a lot in the process.
In this time, I experienced the difference in development time gained from having a basic framing structure layed out prior to working on the actual meat of the game.
Below is a video of a playthrough of the final game.
You can also find the scripts and assets we used in the game by following the link in the projects tab or clicking <a href="https://github.com/punster94/FogOfWar">here</a>.
