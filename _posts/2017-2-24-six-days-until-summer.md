Our fifth rapid prototype project required that we make a game that incorporated advanced technology.
I worked on a team of six as one of two programmers.
We chose Vive VR as our interface.
This was the second game I worked on that made extensive use of dialog, as it was a VR dating simulator.
Again, I approached the situation using XML.
This actually made it so decoupled that our script-writer never actually opened Unity during development (for better or worse).

Six Days Until Summer is a VR dating simulator that follows the story of a girl who enrolls in an all-boys school one week before summer vacation.
As if that wasn't real enough, there also happens to be a very jealous and violent student on the prowl who will stop at nothing to date you.
As you play, you will learn about each of the characters we have developed and get them to love you by increasing their Love Points.
Anyone who survives the game with enough Love Points will appear in the end credits at the beach with you during summer vacation.
The characters are again modeled after students from FIEA's cohort 13, so watch out for King Louis again! (but for real, watch out for him.)

Each day has three rounds of talking in the classroom where you learn facts about your suitors as well as a dating phase every night.
The dates consist of pelting your man with orbs that they may or may not like based on what the orb contains.
In this way, it is good to learn about the character you will date during the dialogue rounds.
Throwing things in VR was a particularly challenging but rewarding experience.

Below is a video of the final game that we presented to our cohort.
This game won us most fun game of the semester at FIEA!
