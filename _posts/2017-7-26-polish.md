With the teams moving their players around with respect to each other's roles, it looked like a soccer match.
But something was off with how the players positioned themselves in terms of their reaction to the ball.
The teams continued to play the whole field while the ball was close to the sides, making the farthest players seem non-responsive.
To remedy this, I decided to model the play area that the players position themselves in dynamically, with respect to the two team's general positions and the ball.
The field material in the video below displays the area that the teams consider to be playable:

After this and tweaking some passing behaviors, I was content with the consistency of play in the simulation.
I did, however, feel that the simulation lacked flair!
The video below demonstrates some camerawork, camera shakes, and time dialation effects that I added to spice up the simulation experience:

This project was overall interesting and pretty fun!
I enjoyed the opportunity to make use of the state pattern as well as delve a bit more into AI practices.
