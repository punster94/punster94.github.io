The FIEA curriculum consists of, on top of academic classes, a capstone project that is worked on in a larger group over the course of two semesters.
I am lead programmer on team Project Polish Productions assisting in the creation of our game: Hollow.
This is a large project, so it would be hard to go into details of what I have worked on when showing what we have so far.
In the future I will make posts when tackling a particularly challenging problem (like a stretch and squash shader for a spirit).

Over the last two months I've been introduced to or increasingly familiarized with many new things:
* The Unreal Engine (UE4)
* Material and shader logic
* Applications of C++ design patterns
* Mesh, Texturing, and Animation pipelines
* Blueprint logic
* Blueprint / C++ inheritance and communication

Below is a cinematic video demonstrating some magic moments we plan to provide in our game.

And here is a video of our mechanical concepts built for vertical slice.

Additionally, here is a snapshot of our visual standard from our vertical slice presentation.
