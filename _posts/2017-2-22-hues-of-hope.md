Our second rapid prototype project in the FIEA curriculum stole some thunder from one of our future classes.
This project required that we make a game with a primary purpose other than entertainment.
Again I worked as one of two programmers on a team of six people.
I have had previous experience working in Unity, so the process was not unknown to me.
This game was, however, the first game that I developed using 3D assets.
This gave me a peek at the general pipeline for developing and including these files.

In Hues of Hope, you take on the persona of a college student who suffers from depression.
You navigate her dorm and find things to interact with to literally brighten your day.
However, your 'happiness' deteriorates over time so you must find the motivation to perform actions.
You can gather momentum through the day by performing small, productive actions.

You get called periodically throughout the experience, often rejecting it.
Your objective is to improve your mood enough to answer the call and allow people to support you.

The game is not a means to cure clinical depression, nor a means to teach how to support someone with clinical depression.

Below is a video of a playthrough of the final game.
You can also find the code and assets we used in the game by following the link in the projects tab or clicking <a href="https://github.com/punster94/HuesOfHope">here</a>.
